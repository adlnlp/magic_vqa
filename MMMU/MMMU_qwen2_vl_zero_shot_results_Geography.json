    "To determine the closest option for the pore water pressure at point G, we need to analyze the given information and the flow network in the figure.\n\n1. The storage height of the small homogeneous earth dam is 16 meters.\n2. The flow network shows the water head gradient equipotential lines.\n3. The interval of the water head gradient equipotential lines is evenly divided into m = 22.\n4. Point G is located on the 20th equipotential line, 11.5 meters above the ground level.\n\nGiven that the storage height is 16 meters and the interval of the equipotential lines is 22, we can calculate the height of each equipotential line:\n\n\\[ \\text{Height per equipotential line} = \\frac{\\text{Total storage height}}{\\text{Number of equipotential lines}} = \\frac{16}{22} \\approx 0.727 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nThe 20th equipotential line is 11.5 meters above the ground level. Therefore, the height of the 20th equipotential line from the ground is:\n\n\\[ 11.5 - 0.727 \\times 19 \\approx 11.5 - 13.813 \\approx -2.313 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nSince the height cannot be negative, we need to adjust our calculation. The correct approach is to calculate the height of the 20th equipotential line from the ground level:\n\n\\[ 11.5 - 0.727 \\times 20 \\approx 11.5 - 14.54 \\approx -3.04 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nHowever, this calculation is incorrect because we should not subtract the height of the 20th equipotential line from the ground level. Instead, we should calculate the height of the 20th equipotential line from the ground level:\n\n\\[ 11.5 + 0.727 \\times 20 \\approx 11.5 + 14.54 \\approx 26.04 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nThis calculation is still incorrect because we should not add the height of the 20th equipotential line to the ground level. Instead, we should calculate the height of the 20th",

    "To calculate the punching shear bearing capacity \\(F_{p}\\) of the cushion cap, we need to use the formula for punching shear capacity of a reinforced concrete slab:\n\n\\[ F_{p} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot b \\cdot d \\cdot f_{t} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(b\\) is the effective width of the slab (in this case, the width of the column section, which is 0.6m)\n- \\(d\\) is the effective depth of the slab (in this case, the cushion cap thickness, which is 1.2m)\n- \\(f_{t}\\) is the tensile strength design value of the concrete (in this case, 1.27 MPa)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ F_{p} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 0.6 \\cdot 1.2 \\cdot 1.27 \\]\n\n\\[ F_{p} = 0.3 \\cdot 1.2 \\cdot 1.27 \\]\n\n\\[ F_{p} = 0.36 \\cdot 1.27 \\]\n\n\\[ F_{p} = 0.4572 \\]\n\nTherefore, the punching shear bearing capacity \\(F_{p}\\) of the cushion cap is approximately 0.4572 kN.\n\nThe closest option to this value is:\n\nC. 0.4572 kN",

    "To determine the length of the bored pile body, we need to use the information provided in the figure and the given wave velocity value. The figure shows the low strain reflected wave dynamic test curve, which includes the times \\( t_1 \\), \\( t_2 \\), and \\( t_3 \\).\n\nThe length of the pile can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Length} = \\frac{\\text{Wave Velocity} \\times \\text{Time}}{2} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- Wave Velocity = 3555.6 m/s\n- Times \\( t_1 \\), \\( t_2 \\), and \\( t_3 \\) are not explicitly provided, but we can assume they are the times corresponding to the peaks of the wave.\n\nLet's assume \\( t_1 \\), \\( t_2 \\), and \\( t_3 \\) are the times corresponding to the peaks of the wave. The length of the pile can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. For \\( t_1 \\):\n\\[ \\text{Length}_{t_1} = \\frac{3555.6 \\times t_1}{2} \\]\n\n2.

However, we can estimate the length by assuming the times are evenly spaced or by using the average time.\n\nAssuming the times are evenly spaced, we can estimate the length as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Length} = \\frac{\\text{Length}_{t_1} + \\text{Length}_{t_2} + \\text{Length}_{t_3}}{3} \\]\n\nLet's calculate the average length using the given wave velocity and assuming the times are evenly spaced:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Length} = \\frac{3555.6 \\times (t_1 + t_2 + t_3)}{6} \\]\n\nWithout the exact values of \\( t_1 \\), \\( t_2 \\), and \\( t_3 \\),"
