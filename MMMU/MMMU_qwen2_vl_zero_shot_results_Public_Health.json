    "To calculate the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the odds ratio (OR) in the 25-29 years age group, we need to use the formula for the CI of a proportion. The formula for the CI of a proportion is:\n\n\\[ \\text{CI} = \\hat{p} \\pm z \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(\\hat{p}\\) is the proportion of interest (in this case, the proportion of MI patients among the total population in the 25-29 years age group),\n- \\(z\\) is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (95% CI corresponds to a z-score of approximately 1.96),\n- \\(n\\) is the sample size.\n\nFrom the table, we have:\n- MI group: 6 (2.6%) in the 25-29 years age group.\n- Control group: 286 (16.4%) in the 25-29 years age group.\n\nFirst, calculate the proportion of MI patients in the 25-29 years age group:\n\\[ \\hat{p} = \\frac{6}{6 + 286} = \\frac{6}{292} \\approx 0.0206 \\]\n\nNext, calculate the standard error (SE):\n\\[ \\text{SE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.0206(1-0.0206)}{292}} \\approx 0.013 \\]\n\nNow, calculate the 95% CI:\n\\[ \\text{CI} = \\hat{p} \\pm z \\times \\text{SE} = 0.0206 \\pm 1.96 \\times 0.013 \\]\n\\[ \\text{CI} = 0.0206 \\pm 0.026 \\]\n\\[ \\text{CI} = (0.0206 - 0.026, 0.0206 + 0.026) \\]\n\\[ \\text{CI} = (-0.0054, 0.0466) \\]\n\nHowever, since the proportion cannot be",
