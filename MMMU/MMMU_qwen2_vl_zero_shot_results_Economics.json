    "To calculate the price elasticity of demand, we use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Price Elasticity of Demand} = \\frac{\\text{Percentage change in quantity demanded}}{\\text{Percentage change in price}} \\]\n\nGiven the price increases from $8 to $10, we first calculate the percentage change in price:\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage change in price} = \\frac{\\text{New price} - \\text{Old price}}{\\text{Old price}} \\times 100 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage change in price} = \\frac{10 - 8}{8} \\times 100 = \\frac{2}{8} \\times 100 = 25\\% \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the percentage change in quantity demanded:\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage change in quantity demanded} = \\frac{\\text{New quantity demanded} - \\text{Old quantity demanded}}{\\text{Old quantity demanded}} \\times 100 \\]\n\nFor the price of $10, the quantity demanded is 45 DVDs. For the price of $8, the quantity demanded is 50 DVDs.\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage change in quantity demanded} = \\frac{45 - 50}{50} \\times 100 = \\frac{-5}{50} \\times 100 = -10\\% \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the price elasticity of demand:\n\n\\[ \\text{Price Elasticity of Demand} = \\frac{-10\\%}{25\\%} = -0.4 \\]\n\nHowever, the question asks for the price elasticity of demand as the price of DVDs increases from $8 to $10 if your income is $12,000. The table shows that the quantity demanded at $10 with an income of $12,000 is 45 DVDs. Therefore, the price elasticity of demand is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Price Elasticity of Demand} = \\frac{-10\\%}{25\\%} = -0.4 \\]\n\nThe closest answer choice is:\n\nD. 0.47",
