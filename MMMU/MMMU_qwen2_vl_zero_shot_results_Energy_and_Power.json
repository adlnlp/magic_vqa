    "To evaluate the surface temperature of the heat source, we can use the concept of thermal resistance and the heat transfer equation for a hemispherical heat source. The heat transfer equation for a hemispherical heat source embedded in a substrate is given by:\n\n\\[ q = \\frac{2\\pi k r_o^2 \\Delta T}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{r_o}{r_i}\\right)} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( q \\) is the heat dissipation rate (4 W in this case),\n- \\( k \\) is the thermal conductivity of the substrate (125 W/m·K),\n- \\( r_o \\) is the radius of the hemispherical heat source (0.1 mm or 0.0001 m),\n- \\( \\Delta T \\) is the temperature difference between the surface of the heat source and the ambient temperature,\n- \\( r_i \\) is the radius of the inner boundary of the substrate.\n\nGiven that the substrate is large and the heat source is well insulated, we can assume that the temperature difference \\( \\Delta T \\) is small compared to the ambient temperature \\( T_\\infty \\). Therefore, we can approximate the temperature difference as:\n\n\\[ \\Delta T \\approx T_s - T_\\infty \\]\n\nwhere \\( T_s \\) is the surface temperature of the heat source.\n\nRearranging the heat transfer equation to solve for \\( T_s \\):\n\n\\[ T_s = T_\\infty + \\frac{q \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_o}{r_i}\\right)}{2\\pi k r_o^2} \\]\n\nSince \\( r_i \\) is not given, we can assume it to be much larger than \\( r_o \\) (e.g., the thickness of the substrate), so \\( \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_o}{r_i}\\right) \\approx -\\infty \\), which makes the term involving \\( \\ln \\) negligible compared to the other terms. Therefore, we can simplify the equation to:\n\n\\[ T_s \\approx T_\\infty + \\frac{q}{2\\pi k r_o^2} \\]\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n\\[ T_s \\approx 27 + \\frac{4}{2\\pi \\cdot 125 \\cdot (0.0001)^2} \\]\n\n\\[ T_s \\approx 27 + \\frac{4}{2\\pi \\cdot 125",
