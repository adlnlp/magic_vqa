    "To find the power supplied by the 6-V source, we need to calculate the current flowing through the 6-V source and then use the formula P = IV, where P is power, I is current, and V is voltage.\n\nFirst, let's find the total resistance of the circuit. The total resistance is the sum of the individual resistances:\n\n- The 4-ohm resistor\n- The 2-ohm resistor (which is in parallel with the 1-ohm resistor)\n- The 3-ohm resistor\n\nThe 2-ohm resistor is in parallel with the 1-ohm resistor, so their combined resistance is given by the formula for parallel resistors: 1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2. Therefore, the combined resistance of the 2-ohm and 1-ohm resistors is:\n\n1/R_total = 1/2 + 1/1 = 1/2 + 1 = 3/2\nR_total = 2/3 ohms\n\nNow, we can find the total resistance of the circuit:\n\nR_total = 4 + 2/3 + 3 = 4 + 2/3 + 3 = 7 + 2/3 ohms\n\nNow, we can find the current flowing through the 6-V source. The voltage across the 6-V source is 6 V, and the total resistance of the circuit is 7 + 2/3 ohms. The current (I) can be found using Ohm's Law: I = V/R.\n\nI = 6 V / (7 + 2/3) ohms\nI = 6 V / (7 + 2/3) ohms\nI = 6 V / (7 + 2/3) ohms\nI = 6 V / (7 + 2/3) ohms\nI = 6 V / (7 + 2/3) ohms\nI = 6 V / (7 + 2/3) ohms\nI = 6 V / (7 + 2/3) ohms\nI = 6 V / (7 + 2/3) ohms\nI = 6 V / (7 + 2/3) ohms\nI = 6 V / (7 + 2/3) ohms\nI = 6 V / (7 + 2",
