The maximum possible loss for a strangle strategy is the difference between the strike price of the call option and the strike price of the put option, minus the total premium paid for both options. In this case, the maximum possible loss is $60 - $55 = $5. However, since the client is long both the call and put options, the maximum possible loss is the difference between the strike prices, which is $60 - $55 = $5. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",
