    "The substance in the image is 3-chloro-1-methylcyclohexane. \n\nTo determine whether it is cis- or trans-, we need to look at the orientation of the chlorine and methyl groups. In this case, the chlorine and methyl groups are on the same side of the ring, which indicates that it is a cis-isomer. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. cis-3-chloro-1-methylcyclohexane",

    "To determine which anion is most likely to have the strongest interactions with nearby water molecules in an aqueous solution, we need to consider the ionic radius of each anion. The stronger the interaction with water molecules, the smaller the ionic radius, as smaller ions can more easily form hydrogen bonds with water.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Cl^−: 181 pm\n- I^−: 216 pm\n- S^{2−}: 184 pm\n- Te^{2−}: 221 pm\n\nThe Cl^− ion has the smallest ionic radius (181 pm), which suggests it will have the strongest interactions with nearby water molecules due to its ability to form more hydrogen bonds.\n\nTherefore, the best option is:\nA. Cl^−",
