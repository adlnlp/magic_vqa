    "To determine the maximum value of live load force created in bar CG, we need to consider the effects of both the uniform live load and the concentrated live load.\n\n1. **Uniform Live Load:**\n   - The uniform live load is 0.32 kips/ft.\n   - The span length is 90 ft.\n   - The total uniform live load force is \\( 0.32 \\, \\text{kip/ft} \\times 90 \\, \\text{ft} = 28.8 \\, \\text{kips} \\).\n\n2. **Concentrated Live Load:**\n   - The concentrated live load is 24 kips.\n   - This load can be positioned to produce the largest force in bar CG.\n\n3. **Maximum Force in Bar CG:**\n   - The maximum force in bar CG will occur when the concentrated load is applied at the midpoint of the span, directly above bar CG.\n   - The maximum force in bar CG due to the concentrated load is 24 kips.\n\n4. **Total Maximum Force in Bar CG:**\n   - The total maximum force in bar CG is the sum of the uniform live load force and the concentrated live load force.\n   - Total maximum force = 28.8 kips + 24 kips = 52.8 kips.\n\n5. **Type of Force:**\n   - Since the concentrated load is applied at the midpoint of the span, it will create a compressive force in bar CG.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of live load force created in bar CG is 52.8 kips compression.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. 5.75kips compression.",
    "To determine the number of photographs required to cover a strip 16 km long at a flying height of 1350 m with a longitudinal overlap of 60%, we need to calculate the strip width and then divide the total strip length by the strip width.\n\n1. **Calculate the strip width:**\n   - The strip width is determined by the camera's format and focal length. For Camera A:\n     - Format: 180 mm x 180 mm\n     - Focal length: 210 mm\n     - The strip width is approximately equal to the focal length, so the strip width for Camera A is 210 mm.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of photographs for Camera A:**\n   - The strip length is 16 km, which is 16,000 meters.\n   - The flying height is 1350 meters.\n   - The longitudinal overlap is 60%, which means the next photograph will start 60% of the strip width from the previous photograph.\n   - The strip width for Camera A is 210 mm, which is 0.21 meters.\n   - The longitudinal overlap is 60%, so the next photograph will start at 0.60 * 0.21 = 0.126 meters from the previous photograph.\n   - The effective strip width for each photograph is the strip width minus the longitudinal overlap: 0.21 - 0.126 = 0.084 meters.\n   - The number of photographs required is the total strip length divided by the effective strip width: 16,000 / 0.084 ≈ 190,476.\n\nSince the question asks for the number of photographs taken by Camera A, and the strip width is not directly provided for Camera B, we can assume that the strip width for Camera B is similar to Camera A for the purpose of this calculation. However, the question specifically asks for the number of photographs taken by Camera A, and the strip width for Camera B is not relevant to this calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA.35.567 $\\approx$ 36",

    "To determine the maximum force in bar CM produced by the live load, we need to analyze the truss structure and apply the given loads. The live load consists of a uniformly distributed load of 0.8 kip/ft and a concentrated load of 20 kips.\n\n1. **Uniformly Distributed Load (UDL):**\n   - The UDL acts over the entire length of the truss, which is 144 ft.\n   - The maximum force due to UDL can be calculated by multiplying the UDL by the length of the truss.\n   - Maximum force due to UDL = 0.8 kip/ft * 144 ft = 115.2 kips.\n\n2. **Concentrated Load:**\n   - The concentrated load of 20 kips acts at the center of the truss.\n   - This load will cause additional forces at the joints where it is applied.\n\n3. **Analysis:**\n   - Since Joint E acts as a hinge, the forces at Joint E will be determined by the equilibrium equations.\n   - The maximum force in bar CM will be influenced by the forces at Joint E and the reactions at the supports.\n\n4. **Maximum Force Calculation:**\n   - The maximum force in bar CM will be the sum of the forces due to the UDL and the concentrated load.\n   - Maximum force in bar CM = 115.2 kips + 20 kips = 135.2 kips.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The maximum force in bar CM is 135.2 kips, which is the sum of the forces due to the UDL and the concentrated load.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC.
