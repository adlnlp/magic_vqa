    "To calculate the budgeted total cash receipts for November, we need to consider both cash sales and collectible credit sales. Here's the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1. **Cash Sales for November:**\n   - Cash sales for November = $120,000\n\n2. **Collectible Credit Sales for November:**\n   - Credit sales for November = $150,000\n   - 5% of credit sales are uncollectible, so 95% are collectible.\n   - Collectible credit sales = 95% of $150,000 = 0.95 * $150,000 = $142,500\n\n3. **Cash Receipts from Collectible Credit Sales:**\n   - 60% of collectible credit sales are collected in the month of sale.\n   - Cash receipts from collectible credit sales in November = 60% of $142,500 = 0.60 * $142,500 = $85,500\n   - 40% of collectible credit sales are collected in the month following the month of sale.\n   - Cash receipts from collectible credit sales in December = 40% of $142,500 = 0.40 * $142,500 = $57,000\n\n4. **Total Cash Receipts for November:**\n   - Total cash receipts = Cash sales for November + Cash receipts from collectible credit sales in November\n   - Total cash receipts = $120,000 + $85,500 = $205,500\n\nTherefore, the budgeted total cash receipts for November are $205,500.",
    "To determine the best option for the forecasted room registrations in year 11, we need to analyze the given time-series data and develop a regression equation.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the average annual increase in room registrations:\n\nYear 1: 17\nYear 2: 16\nYear 3: 16\nYear 4: 21\nYear 5: 20\nYear 6: 20\nYear 7: 23\nYear 8: 25\nYear 9: 24\n\nAverage increase per year = (25 - 17) / 9 = 8 / 9 ≈ 0.89\n\nNow, let's calculate the room registrations for year 11 using the regression equation:\n\nYear 11 = Year 9 + (9 * 0.89)\nYear 11 = 24 + (9 * 0.89)\nYear 11 = 24 + 8.01\nYear 11 ≈ 32.01\n\nThe closest option to 32.01 is:\n\nC. 27030",

    "To calculate the commission on the sale, we need to determine the amount of the purchase and then apply the appropriate commission rate from the table.\n\n1. **Amount of Purchase:**\n   - Mr. Samuels purchased 50 shares of stock.\n   - The round lot price was 146(1/8).\n   - The odd-lot differential on the sale is 1/4 of a point.\n\n   Since the odd-lot differential is 1/4 of a point, we need to adjust the round lot price to the nearest whole number. The round lot price is 146(1/8), which is equivalent to 146.125. Adding the odd-lot differential (1/4 of a point) to this price gives us 146.125 + 0.25 = 146.375.\n\n   However, since we are dealing with a round lot price, we will use the round lot price of 146.125 for the calculation.\n\n   The amount of the purchase is:\n   \\[\n   50 \\text{ shares} \\times 146.125 \\text{ dollars/share} = 7306.25 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Commission Calculation:**\n   - The amount of the purchase is $7306.25.\n   - According to the table, the commission rate for purchases between $800 and $2,499 is 1.3% plus $10 up to $65.\n\n   The commission is calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Commission} = 1.3\\% \\times 7306.25 + 10\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Commission} = 0.013 \\times 7306.25 + 10\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Commission} = 94.9825 + 10\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Commission} = 104.9825\n   \\]\n\n   Since the commission is typically rounded to the nearest dollar, the commission on the sale is $105.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D: $105**.",

    "To determine the probability that the path B-D will be finished in 22 weeks or less, we need to calculate the expected time and variance for the path B-D.\n\nThe path B-D consists of activities B and D.\n\n1. Calculate the expected time (E) for each activity:\n- Activity B: E(B) = 10 weeks (since it's the only activity on this path)\n- Activity D: E(D) = 8 weeks (since it's the only activity on this path)\n\n2. Calculate the variance (Var) for each activity:\n- Activity B: Var(B) = 0 (since it's the only activity on this path)\n- Activity D: Var(D) = 0 (since it's the only activity on this path)\n\n3. Since the activity times are independent, the variance of the path B-D is the sum of the variances of the individual activities:\nVar(B-D) = Var(B) + Var(D) = 0 + 0 = 0\n\n4. The expected time for the path B-D is the sum of the expected times of the individual activities:\nE(B-D) = E(B) + E(D) = 10 + 8 = 18 weeks\n\n5. The variance of the path B-D is 0, which means the path B-D is deterministic and will take exactly 18 weeks.\n\n6. Since the path B-D is deterministic, the probability that it will be finished in 22 weeks or less is 100%.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the path B-D will be finished in 22 weeks or less is 100%.",
