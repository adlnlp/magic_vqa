    "To determine the shear strain $\\gamma_{xy}$ at the corner B, we need to calculate the change in angle at the corner due to the distortion of the plastic. The shear strain is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma_{xy} = \\frac{\\Delta \\theta}{\\Delta x}\n\\]\n\nwhere $\\Delta \\theta$ is the change in angle and $\\Delta x$ is the distance over which the angle changes.\n\nFrom the figure, we can see that the original angle at corner B is 90 degrees (or $\\pi/2$ radians). After the distortion, the angle at corner B changes to 90 degrees plus the angle of distortion at the corner.\n\nThe angle of distortion at the corner can be calculated using the change in length and the original length. The change in length is the difference between the original length and the distorted length.\n\nFor the x-direction:\n- Original length = 400 mm\n- Distorted length = 400 mm + 3 mm = 403 mm\n\nFor the y-direction:\n- Original length = 300 mm\n- Distorted length = 300 mm + 2 mm = 302 mm\n\nThe angle of distortion can be calculated using the change in length and the original length:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta \\theta = \\frac{\\Delta x}{x} = \\frac{3 mm}{400 mm} = 0.0075 \\text{ radians}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the shear strain:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma_{xy} = \\frac{\\Delta \\theta}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{0.0075 \\text{ radians}}{3 mm} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ radians/mm}\n\\]\n\nHowever, this is not one of the options provided. It seems there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the question or the options. The correct answer based on the calculation is not listed among the options. Please double-check the question and the options provided.",

    "To determine the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature, we need to find the temperature corresponding to the average of the maximum and minimum impact energies. From the table:\n\n- Maximum impact energy: 124 J (at -25째C)\n- Minimum impact energy: 6 J (at -175째C)\n\nThe average impact energy is calculated as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Average Impact Energy} = \\frac{\\text{Maximum Impact Energy} + \\text{Minimum Impact Energy}}{2} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Average Impact Energy} = \\frac{124 + 6}{2} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Average Impact Energy} = \\frac{130}{2} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Average Impact Energy} = 65 \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the temperature corresponding to this average impact energy. From the table, the temperature corresponding to an impact energy of 65 J is approximately -105째C.\n\nTherefore, the best option is:\nC. -105째C",
